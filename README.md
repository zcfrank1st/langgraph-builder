# LangGraph Builder 🦜 🎨

LangGraph Builder is a powerful canvas for designing cognitive architectures of LangGraph applications. After designing the architecture, LangGraph Builder enables you to quickly generate boilerplate code for the application in Python and Typescript. Code generation in LangGraph Builder is powered by [langgraph-gen](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-gen-py). Try LangGraph Builder out [here!](https://build.langchain.com)
